# Check-in 1
## First Function 
Will be responsible for creating and showing a 3D model of the human body. It will allow people to interact with it by zooming in, rotating, and clicking different parts of the body
## Second Function
Will allow users to click specific parts and it will read out the definition of the body part you clicked on. If clicked on the heart it would read the hear is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system
## Third Function 
Will be able to detect which part of the body the person is clicking on. This will trigger the definition to appear when you click on the body part


# Check-in 2 
## Introduction 
This is a program that will be interactive with a 3D model of the human body. People will be able to rotate, zoom, and click on different parts of the body to learn names, and definitions. As a future occupational therapist I wanted to create somethign that will help students engage with anatomy in an immersive way. 

## Functions 
create_3dmodel()
this will display the human body as a interactive 3D 
detect_click(body, click_position)
this will tell you the body part you clicked and give you its name 
speak_definition(body_part_def)
this will display the definition of the body part that was clicked on 

## Example Use Case 
showing someone who does not know the body (a small child) the basics of the body  

## Data Input 
Pyvista

# Project Description 
  This project is used to show the basic anatomy of a human (head, torso, arms, legs, etc.). It uses a 3D model of the human body which you can rotate and move to show others and teach yourself the basics. This could be applied to smaller childeren who are learning about the basics of the body and understanding where they are on your body. 

# 3 Functions 
  load_model is something I take pride on because of all the trials and errors. Having to look back at the model and figure out exactly why my model was not printing out the statements and rewording and rewording. Finally to see that I was going in the complete wrong direction. I had to go back and redo my dictionary to nodes so it could implement the code correctly. Second, the run having to go just from the basic plotter to put in the isinstance was extremely hard for me. Just being able to run the code and being able to click on the body was what made me extremely happy. Last is being able to put the .gbl into my code, yes yes should be easy, but no. It was much harder than I thought trying to make a interactive code that allows you to click on different parts of the body. 

# Extra credit 
  I believe I deserve that one point because I had never used blender before. I had to change my 3D body into meshes which would then allow me to interact with the different body parts. From there I had to use the exact names the meshes gave me which is what gave me such a hard time in running the body parts. After many youtube videos I learned that to be able to run the code the dictionary had to be in the exact order and use the names that were given which in my case were "nodes". Yes, I do believe from my understanding of this class that inputing a interactive 3D model is extremely over the top as well as being able to click on the different parts and it shows a box around the body part so you know exactly where it starts and stops. I am not the best at coding as even with this final I will still fail the class but this final project has given me a lot of courage and will to take it again and know that I am much better than the grade that will be given to me.
